    \byline{\Large Commuter Marvel}{Lisa Eldredge}
    The route to preschool was walkable but the school was situated near the
    top of a very steep hill. At the time Jordan loved to roller skate. One
    morning instead of walking to school he wanted to skate. I agreed, thinking
    that he would soon find the hill too steep and we'd be carrying the skates.
    We set off down our hill then up the slope to the school. Cheerfully making
    slow and steady progress he made it to the top. Along the way his
    classmates passed us by in their cars and cheered him on.

    Jordan made the commute to school by roller skate most of the rest of the
    year, garnering plenty of awe and admiration for his patience and prowess
    to conquer that hill every morning.

    \byline{\Large Boy Defies Mother}{Lisa Eldredge}
    Before Kindergarten school-picture day Jordan came home very excited
    proposing that he wear our dress-up band jacket and hat. I agreed but on
    the condition that he take off the hat for the photo and hold it in his
    lap. He wasn't too happy with that idea but agreed. A few weeks later when
    the photos came, there looking at me from the glossy photo was the happiest
    5 year old you have ever seen. Upright and glowing in the red band jacket
    and most notably, the white patent leather hat perched proudly on his head.
    I smiled back at the image, hugged Jordan for such a wonderful photo,
    noting that my heart was so glad for his joy that I had no motivation to
    reprimand him.

    Moral of the story: Play it safe. If you are going to defy your mother,
    don't have someone take a photo of you in the act.

    \byline{\Large Die Rose, die Lilie}{Jordan Eldredge} I first learned this
    Heinrich Heine poem as part of Robert Schumann's {\it Dichterliebe} song
    cycle. This cycle has always been special to me. One of the first birthday
    gifts I gave to Chelsea was wrapped in it's sheet music. The first piece of
    jewelry I gave to Chelsea was a silver ring in a decorated matchbox
    inscribed with this poem.

    Recently I asked Chelsea to choose the inscription for the inside of my
    wedding band. She chose ``Die Eine''.
