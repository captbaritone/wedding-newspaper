\byline{\Large Jordan's Broken Arm}{Gilbert Eldredge}
When Jordan was about 13, he and Nathaniel and friends liked to ride their
bikes over to a county park, about a mile from our house. At the park there was
a rope swing on a steep hill. The other boys were swinging on the rope, but
Jordan was hesitant. He finally tried it and when he had swung all the way
out---he let go! Jordan hurt his arm and couldn't ride and had to push his bike
home with one hand. The other boys thoughtfully walked with him.

When he got home Jordan's arm really hurt but it didn't look broken. Well three
days later it hadn't gotten better, and because it was Sunday we took him to
the emergency room. When the doctor said it was broken we felt awful. The
doctor said it's hard to know if it is broken and that parents make this
mistake all the time.
