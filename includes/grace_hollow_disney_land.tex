\byline{\Large Disneyland with Chelsea}{Grace Hollow}
Disneyland with Chelsea at age 2 was an amazing treat. Chelsea couldn't talk yet
but we were getting in lines and going on rides. She was so happy.  A special
outdoor show was being announced and we all stood around to watch a high diver
climb up a 30-foot ladder and dive into a small pool. Chelsea became
hysterical, crying and we didn't know what was wrong. This was so unlike her
because she was always such a happy baby. We walked away from the event and she
calmed down immediately.

When Jenna was six months old, we drove to Ventura
and Chelsea (now a very expressive girl) said we should take Jenna to
Disneyland. I agreed that we should plan a trip. Then she added, ``But I don't
want Daddy to go on that ladder and jump in that little pool!''
