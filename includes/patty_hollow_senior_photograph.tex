\byline{\Large Senior Photograph}{Patty Hollow}
One memory that sticks in my brain is when Chelsea came into me for makeup for
her senior photograph and although I always thought she were very cute, when
I got into her face I was astounded by just how beautiful she was!  Her skin
was so perfect and clear, and her eyes were huge and a true almond shape that
she hardly needed anything,  but because it was a photograph I did the whole
photo finish look and was so pleased with the results that I paraded her around
the shop. It is so clear in my mind and unlike many other girls that came into
me she wanted to be understated and that is who she is; a perfect lady in
a ``world gone wild!''
