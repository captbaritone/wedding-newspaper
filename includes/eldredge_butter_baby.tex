\headline{\Large Butter Baby}

From a recent interview with Jordan Eldredge's parents:
\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Jorelsea Journal} I understand you used to do some camping with
your kids when they were young. Do you have any memorable moments?
\speak{Lisa} Yes, when Jordan was about 16 months old we went on a weekend
camping trip with friends. When we arrived at the campsite we thought were
staying ahead of Jordanâ€™s penchant for butter by putting the cooler on top of
the picnic table. 
\speak{J.J.} So the cooler had butter in it?
\speak{Gilbert} Yes
\speak{J.J.} So up on the picnic table would be out of reach?
\speak{Lisa} Yes, and we figured it was overkill to put it on the table because
the cooler was difficult to open, certainly way too hard for a young toddler to
break into.
\speak{Gilbert} So anyway, we set up our chairs and were visiting with our
friends when one of them said, ``Look behind you.''
\speak{Lisa} We turned around. And not only was Jordan up on the picnic table
but he had managed to open that cooler and had found the butter. 
\speak{Gilbert} He had peeled the paper on the cube back like a banana and was
deliriously chowing down on large bitefuls of the stick!
\speak{Lisa} What a picture he was on the table, naked except for his cloth
diaper, greasy and in heaven!
