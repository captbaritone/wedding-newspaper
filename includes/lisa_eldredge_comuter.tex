\byline{\Large Commuter Marvel}{Lisa Eldredge}
The route to preschool was walkable but the school was situated near the top of
a very steep hill. At the time Jordan loved to roller skate. One morning
instead of walking to school he wanted to skate. I agreed, thinking that he
would soon find the hill too steep and we'd be carrying the skates.  We set off
down our hill then up the slope to the school. Cheerfully making slow and
steady progress he made it to the top. Along the way his classmates passed us
by in their cars and cheered him on.

Jordan made the commute to school by roller skate most of the rest of the year,
garnering plenty of awe and admiration for his patience and prowess to conquer
that hill every morning.
