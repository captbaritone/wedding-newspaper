\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On my favorite vacation\\
in the state of 10,000 lakes\\
We went on a boat ride\\
one was especially great\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On our way back\\
we had to make a stop\\
We went turtle hunting\\
on a restaurant dock\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
All that I could smell\\
was the scent of French Fries\\
All that I could hear\\
was the laughter + cries\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
We looked in the water\\
with not much luck\\
Searching for turtles\\
all we could see was muck\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
While looking off\\
one of the sides\\
I saw my friend Chelsea\\
in the corner of my eye\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I just couldn't help\\
but push her in\\
Afterward I would regret\\
what I had did\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I ran to the boat\\
and wouldn't get out\\
Then all I heard were\\
screams + shouts\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When we finally got home\\
what I deserved I got\\
Five pushes in the lake\\
that was sure alot\\
\end{verse}
