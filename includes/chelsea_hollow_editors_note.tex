Simply put, I love tradition. So much, I often create them from scratch and
just call it a tradition from the get-go. For instance, once during a blackout,
Jordan and I decided that the only entertainment we had without electricity was
to make coffee. So, of course our coffee became quite an extravagant venture,
complete with whipped milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar\ldots you name it! We then
walked to the nearest taqueria to get burritos. We decided this would be
a tradition and anytime we wanted, we could turn off the lights and have our
own blackout.

As we began to plan our wedding I became fascinated by world wedding
traditions. In my search through these I found this German tradition of
compiling a newspaper. We thought it sounded fun but really had no clue it
would be this rewarding. Family and friends have contributed and it has become
a treasured part of our wedding memory. Thank you for all of your
contributions! We hope to continue this tradition for future moments of
celebration!
