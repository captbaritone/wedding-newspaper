    \it A Serio-Comic Toast to Chelsea and Jordan\\
}

\begin{verse}
Feet full of steps towards achieving your heart-felt dreams\\
Legs full of operatic roles of a lifetime, jumping jacks and walks along the beach\\
Arms full of hugs, grocery bags and sacks of gold \textemdash and, of course, ``little mini-me's''\\
Hands full of magical endeavors\\
Hearts full of love, trust and respect\\
Heads full of inspirational world changing ideas\\
Eyes full of wonder\\
Ears full of intimate whispers\\
Noses full of magnificent aromas and fragrances\\
Mouths full of words of wisdom\\
Voices full of the worldâ€™s most poignant arias\\
Minds full of curiosity and imagination\\
Souls full of compassion, dignity and courage\\
\end{verse}

{\centering
    In other words:\\
    Chelsea and Jordan, soul mates that you are,\\
    have a joyfully productive lifetime together\ldots\\
    With Love, from Aunt Annette\\
