\byline{\Large Boy Defies Mother}{Lisa Eldredge}
Before Kindergarten school-picture day Jordan came home very excited proposing
that he wear our dress-up band jacket and hat. I agreed but on the condition
that he take off the hat for the photo and hold it in his lap. He wasn't too
happy with that idea but agreed. A few weeks later when the photos came, there
looking at me from the glossy photo was the happiest 5 year old you have ever
seen. Upright and glowing in the red band jacket and most notably, the white
patent leather hat perched proudly on his head.  I smiled back at the image,
hugged Jordan for such a wonderful photo, noting that my heart was so glad for
his joy that I had no motivation to reprimand him.

Moral of the story: Play it safe. If you are going to defy your mother, don't
have someone take a photo of you in the act.
