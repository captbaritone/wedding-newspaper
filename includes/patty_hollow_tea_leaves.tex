\byline{\Large Tea Leaves}{Patty Hollow}
I thought this old poem I wrote was apropos of my grandmother's old tea cups, which I gave Chelsea and Jordan.

{\centering
    You hold me like an antique sugar spoon,\\
    delicate with rounded valley's, curved\\
    to catch the sweentess of my bite.\\
    The intricate Olde English filigree handle\\
    you caress exposes my secret crevasses\\
    polished now to a fine rich patina.\\
    I become as warm and liqud as the amber\\
    Oolong leaves sweetened by rainbow crystals\\
    poured from my gradmother's hand\\
    rubbed silver tea pot.\\
