I thought this old poem I wrote was apropos of the old grandmother tea cups.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Oolong leaves sweetened by rainbow crystals}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
You hold me like an antique sugar spoon,\\
delicate with rounded valley's, curved\\
to catch the sweentess of my bite.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The intricate Olde English filigree handle\\
you caress exposes my secret crevasses\\
polished now to a fine rich patina.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I become as warm and liqud as the amber\\
Oolong leaves sweetened by rainbow crystals\\
poured from my gradmother's hand rubbed silver tea pot.
\end{verse}
