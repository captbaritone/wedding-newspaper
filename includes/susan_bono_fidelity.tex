\byline{\Large From ``Fidelity''}{D.H. Lawrence}
\begin{verse}
Man and woman are like the earth, that brings forth flowers\\
in summer, and love, but underneath is rock.\\
Older than flowers, older than ferns, older that foraminiferae,\\
older than plasm altogether is the soul underneath.\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
And when, throughout all the wild chaos of love\\
slowly a gem forms, in the ancient, once-more molten rocks\\
of two human hearts, two ancient rocks, a man's heart and a woman's,\\
that is the crystal of peace, the slow hard jewel of trust,\\
the sapphire of fidelity.\\
The gem of mutual peace emerging from the wild chaos of love.\\
\end{verse}
