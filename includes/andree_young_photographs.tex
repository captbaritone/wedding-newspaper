This photo of Jordan at The Forest of Dreams is from Sept. 7, 2009. It was
a year after our son, David's death and I was still recovering from
a Bilateral Mastectomy on July 22, 2009. Lisa and Gilbert invited David and
I to stay with them. I remember Jordan's kindness and walking to the top of
a little hill nearby with Jordan by my side. Of course there was music and
a dirty word scrabble game in which Jordan was my partner.

This photo of Chelsea and Aviva is from New Year's Eve, 2012, shortly after or
before she entertained us with the mechanical doll aria from {\it Tales of
Hoffmann}. Aviva said, ``Again!'' and she did it again.
