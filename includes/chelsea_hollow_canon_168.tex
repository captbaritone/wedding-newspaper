\byline{\Large Canon no. 168}{Chelsea Hollow}
As music majors, we trained to sing by sight. This process involved early
morning classes and ritualistic impromptu readings of musical selections in
front of and with classmates. Somehow we not only learned the skill but
also began to enjoy it! One of our text books was a collection of canons,
or melodies like ``Row, Row, Row Your Boat,'' which layer melodies to
create a stunning ensemble.

One night, Alison, Joel, Jordan, and I had been
singing through canons for fun and had made our way through a couple when
we got to number 168, an eight voice canon by Henery Montan Berton
(1767-1844).

Now, sight singing requires quite a bit of concentration; we
rarely know what the piece will sound like once all of the voices are
singing and something about this particular piece has an almost magnetic
charge!  I remember us slowly warping from dorky music grads into what is
maybe more closely related to AC/DC in a closing number. Unfortunately we
had no pyrotechnics on that evening. By the end we were all standing,
rocking out, and belting our hearts out to ``Canon no. 168''!
