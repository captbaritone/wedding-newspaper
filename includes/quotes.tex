\begin{aquote}{Voltaire, Bernstein's Candide}
    ``We're neither pure, nor wise, nor good\\
    We'll do the best we know.\\
    We'll build our house and chop our wood\\
    And make our garden grow.''
\end{aquote}
\begin{aquote}{Stephen Sondheim, Into The Woods}
    It takes one\\
    To begin, but then once you've begun,\\
    It takes two of you.\\
    It's no fun,\\
    But what needs to be done\\
    You can do\\
    When there's two of you.\\
    If I dare,\\
    It's because I'm becoming aware of us\\
    As a pair of us,\\
    Each accepting a share\\
    Of what's there.
\end{aquote}
