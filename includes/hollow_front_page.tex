It has been an exciting 2013 for the families of Jordan Eldredge and
Chelsea Hollow. After 7 years of courtship, Jordan and Chelsea are getting
married! The photo above was taken at their Mock Wedding in Dolores Park,
San Francisco. They were humbled by the friends and family who
traveled from throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and as far away as
Michigan. All gathered to see the bride and groom make their commitment of
love and there was a twist---Jordan was the blushing bride and Chelsea the
proud groom! Cora Values was the officiant and all enjoyed her delightful
improvisation skills which traverse between the truly special and beautiful
to trashy and hilarious.

Both the Eldredge's and Hollow's have known now for some time, that the
bond between Jordan and Chelsea reaches far beyond their family of two.
Tom, Grace, Gilbert, and Lisa all love each other and always look forward
to get-togethers. The September 14th wedding will make it official but it
certainly already feels like family.

When asked for comment, Chelsea Hollow remarked ``I feel so lucky that our
families really love each other! All of the loving support we've received
has been so humbling, what a special time!''
